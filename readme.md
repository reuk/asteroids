Asteroids
=========

A little version of Asteroids in C++14 using just GLFW, GLEW, and GLM.

Done
====

* Hit detection
* Hook up asteroids so that they split when hit by a bullet

Todo
====

* Lives/health for the spaceship
* Particle effects when an asteroid splits
* Precompute asteroid and ship shapes and then reuse them
* Have ship + asteroid classes reference 'static' drawable classes
* Tweak spaceship physics/controls
* Score counter
* Title screen and leaderboard

Maybe
=====

* Thruster animation/visuals
